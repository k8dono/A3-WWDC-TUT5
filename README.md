# A3-WWDC-TUT5
My A3 Project was based around the concepts of creative coding and processing. I wrote and manipulated code through the processing app interface to create a visual interactive creative coding artwork that morphs from one image to another. This repository contains all the compulsory and necessary documents that prove the work and process of my a3 project alongside the actual project itself
